In Figure~\ref{Previous Work and Our Solution}, 
our we will deploy Macaron to provide the automatic check and the Policy Engine to verify currently 
popular repositories.

\subsection{Research Aims}
This research is aim to contribute the Macaron framework, then examine top 100 Python and Java Git 
repositories with this framework. The statistical findings will be further concluded through the further process.
Also, the results will provide the developers and maintainers with a good understanding 
of the vulnerabilities existed in their CI/CD pipelines configuration. Furthermore, the reason behind
these unsafe update will be deeply investigated.

\subsection{Research Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First step: Fetch the repositories build from Python and Java with the top 100 most stars.
    \item Second step: Input the repositories name into the Macaron Framework to analysis. 
    \item Third step: Summarize the outputs generated by Macaron and visualize the results with graphs.
    \item Fourth step: Manually inspecting the code base from the potentially problematic repositories 
    due to not comply with the requirements from the SLSA.
    \item Fifth step: Document and investigate the reason for this suspicious updates.  
\end{enumerate}
