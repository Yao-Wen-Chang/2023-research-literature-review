\section{Introduction}
Continuous Integration\/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) is a development
process for quickly building and testing code changes that helps 
organizations maintain a consistent code base for their applications 
while dynamically integrating code changes. Therefore, CI/CD environments 
are attractive targets for malicious cyber actors (MCAs) whose goals are 
to compromise information by introducing malicious code into CI/CD 
applications, gaining access to intellectual property/trade secrets 
through code theft, or causing denial of service effects against applications.

Recent incidence like the infection of SolarWind's Orien platform \cite{ladisa2023sok, peisert2021perspectives} 
which is used to monitor and manage the network is downloaded by thousands customers, 
including U.S. government agencies, critical infrastrure providers, and private companies. 
 
Section 2 will briefly introduce CI/CD. Section 3 would target the attack
surface within the process of CI/CD and the counter method. In section 4, our literature 
review would introduce SLSA framework from Google, and explain how SLSA can patch 
the vulnerable CI/CD process. In section 6, the aim and objects of the research 
will be explained. And the research plan will be introduced in section 7.
