\begin{abstract}
This literature review will introduce Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD).
Also, some attack surfaces and how the malicious attackers exploit these attack surfaces
to compromise CI/CD pipelines will be covered in this review. Different methods and 
frameworks are going to be introduced to counter the attack. 
Some method target risks at certain stage in the pipeline, but some cover the whole pipeline.

In our research, the framework will focus on Supply Chain Level Security Artifacts 
(SLSA) which is adopted by Google.
