\section{Attack Surface and Impact}

\subsection{Particular Vul}
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode and provides strong safety
guarantees. However, the unsafe API, "sun.misc.Unsafe", will cause serious 
security issue if it is misused by the developers. The research \cite{10.1145/2814270.2814313} 
studied a large repository, Maven, and analyzed the compiled Java code. The 
security issues include violating type safety, crashing the virtual machine (VM)
, uninitialized objects and so on. These misuse might impact third-party package 
management service.
