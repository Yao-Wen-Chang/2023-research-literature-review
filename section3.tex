\section{Attack Surface and Impact}

\subsection{Source Code Repository}
Obtain Git Repository credentials by dumping the environment Variables. Then, user
the stolen secrets to access the Repository and modify the CI/CD configuration.
Finally, the code will successfully be injected into the code base, and affects
downstream users.

\subsection{Build/Test}
\subsection{Deploy}
Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes Java bytecode and provides strong safety
guarantees. However, the unsafe API, "sun.misc.Unsafe", will cause serious 
security issue if it is misused by the developers. The research \cite{mastrangelo2015use} 
studied a large repository, Maven, and analyzed the compiled Java code. The 
security issues include violating type safety, crashing the virtual machine (VM)
, uninitialized objects and so on. These misuse might impact third-party package 
management service.
