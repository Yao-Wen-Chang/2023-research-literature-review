\subsection{Conclusion}

\subsection{Expected Outcomes}
The expected outcomes of this research will be contributing some checks properly to the Macaron 
Framework. Also, finding out vulnerabilites within the popular repositories. Our work expects to 
find out if the CI/CD pipeline configuration or the protection machnism is strong enough to 
avoid unexpected attacks. Taxomony technique mentioned in~\cite{ohm2020backstabber} will be 
implemented in our research to classify the discovered vulnerabilites, and finding out the potential
main goal of the attack according to these vulnerabilites. Finally, our research will expect to 
discover the reason behind these malicious updates.
