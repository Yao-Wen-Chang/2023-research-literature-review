\section{Definition of CI/CD}
CI/CD is a development process for automatically building and testing code changes 
that support orgamizations maintain a consistent code base. CI involves developers
frequently merging code changes into a central repository where automated builds
and tests run. Build is the process of converting source code into executable 
code. Then, running the automated tests against the build. These process will avoid
integration challenges that can happen when waiting for release day to merge changes into the
release branch. CD defined the process of the releases happened automatically. \cite{DoDDefCI/CD2023}. 


The convenience and capabilities of the third-party source code usually 
brings cybersecurity risks \cite{mastrangelo2015use}. Software supply 
chain attacks aim at injecting code into software components to compromise
downstream users \cite{ladisa2023sok}. Some vulnerabilities will be introduced 
in the next section.
