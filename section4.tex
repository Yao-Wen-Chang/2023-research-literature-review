These goals are seek to establish the trust in the software supply chain by verifying in-
formation about the participants or processes \cite{melara2022software}.
The complex CI/CD has the potential to catch the attackers more quickly via peer review, 
because the developers and distributors get a chance to review the code, increasing
the chances of malicious code being discovered \cite{levy2003poisoning}.
Providing cryptographic hashes if the software packages is of significance to
verify the software's integrity \cite{levy2003poisoning}.
Signing the releases of the packages by the providers with the public-key enable the 
users to verify the 

Some of the projects aims at providing single solution that conï¬‚ates multiple objectives 
\cite{melara2022software}.

Despite the previously introduced methods seems to address all the security issue
existed in the code base and within the CI/CD, some of them may overemphasize one 
particular approach to address software supply chain security. without considering 
compounding factors that impact risk \cite{melara2022software}.
